    <p>The countries of the Union, being equally animated by the desire to protect, in as effective and uniform a manner as possible, the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works,</p>
    <p>Recognizing the importance of the work of the Revision Conference held at Stockholm in 1967,</p>
    <p>Have resolved to revise the Act adopted by the Stockholm Conference, while maintaining without change <a>Articles 1 to 20</a> and <a>22 to 26</a> of that Act.</p>
    <p>Consequently, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, having presented their full powers, recognized as in good and due form, have agreed as follows:</p>
    <article>
      <h2 id="1">Article 1</h2>
      <p>The countries to which this Convention applies constitute a Union for the protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="2">Article 2</h2>
      <p>(1) The expression “literary and artistic works” shall include every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression, such as books, pamphlets and other writings; lectures, addresses, sermons and other works of the same nature; dramatic or dramatico-musical works; choreographic works and entertainments in dumb show; musical compositions with or without words; cinematographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; works of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving and lithography; photographic works to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; works of applied art; illustrations, maps, plans, sketches and three-dimensional works relative to geography, topography, architecture or science.</p>
      <p>(2) It shall, however, be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to prescribe that works in general or any specified categories of works shall not be protected unless they have been fixed in some material form.</p>
      <p>(3) Translations, adaptations, arrangements of music and other alterations of a literary or artistic work shall be protected as original works without prejudice to the copyright in the original work.</p>
      <p>(4) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the protection to be granted to official texts of a legislative, administrative and legal nature, and to official translations of such texts.</p>
      <p>(5) Collections of literary or artistic works such as encyclopaedias and anthologies which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such, without prejudice to the copyright in each of the works forming part of such collections.</p>
      <p>(6) The works mentioned in this Article shall enjoy protection in all countries of the Union. This protection shall operate for the benefit of the author and his successors in title.</p>
      <p>(7) Subject to the provisions of <a>Article 7(4)</a> of this Convention, it shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the extent of the application of their laws to works of applied art and industrial designs and models, as well as the conditions under which such works, designs and models shall be protected. Works protected in the country of origin solely as designs and models shall be entitled in another country of the Union only to such special protection as is granted in that country to designs and models; however, if no such special protection is granted in that country, such works shall be protected as artistic works.</p>
      <p>(8) The protection of this Convention shall not apply to news of the day or to miscellaneous facts having the character of mere items of press information.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="2bis">Article 2<em>bis</em></h2>
      <p>(1) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to exclude, wholly or in part, from the protection provided by the preceding Article political speeches and speeches delivered in the course of legal proceedings.</p>
      <p>(2) It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which lectures, addresses and other works of the same nature which are delivered in public may be reproduced by the press, broadcast, communicated to the public by wire and made the subject of public communication as envisaged in <a>Article 11<em>bis</em>(1)</a> of this Convention, when such use is justified by the informatory purpose.</p>
      <p>(3) Nevertheless, the author shall enjoy the exclusive right of making a collection of his works mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="3">Article 3</h2>
      <p>(1) The protection of this Convention shall apply to:</p>
      <p>(a) authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works, whether published or not;</p>
      <p>(b) authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union, for their works first published in one of those countries, or simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union.</p>
      <p>(2) Authors who are not nationals of one of the countries of the Union but who have their habitual residence in one of them shall, for the purposes of this Convention, be assimilated to nationals of that country.</p>
      <p>(3) The expression “published works” means works published with the consent of their authors, whatever may be the means of manufacture of the copies, provided that the availability of such copies has been such as to satisfy the reasonable requirements of the public, having regard to the nature of the work. The performance of a dramatic, dramatico-musical, cinematographic or musical work, the public recitation of a literary work, the communication by wire or the broadcasting of literary or artistic works, the exhibition of a work of art and the construction of a work of architecture shall not constitute publication.</p>
      <p>(4) A work shall be considered as having been published simultaneously in several countries if it has been published in two or more countries within thirty days of its first publication.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="4">Article 4</h2>
      <p>The protection of this Convention shall apply, even if the conditions of <a>Article 3</a> are not fulfilled, to:</p>
      <p>(a) authors of cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or habitual residence in one of the countries of the Union;</p>
      <p>(b) authors of works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or of other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="5">Article 5</h2>
      <p>(1) Authors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention.</p>
      <p>(2) The enjoyment and the exercise of these rights shall not be subject to any formality; such enjoyment and such exercise shall be independent of the existence of protection in the country of origin of the work. Consequently, apart from the provisions of this Convention, the extent of protection, as well as the means of redress afforded to the author to protect his rights, shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the country where protection is claimed.</p>
      <p>(3) Protection in the country of origin is governed by domestic law. However, when the author is not a national of the country of origin of the work for which he is protected under this Convention, he shall enjoy in that country the same rights as national authors.</p>
      <p>(4) The country of origin shall be considered to be:</p>
      <p>(a) in the case of works first published in a country of the Union, that country; in the case of works published simultaneously in several countries of the Union which grant different terms of protection, the country whose legislation grants the shortest term of protection;</p>
      <p>(b) in the case of works published simultaneously in a country outside the Union and in a country of the Union, the latter country;</p>
      <p>(c) in the case of unpublished works or of works first published in a country outside the Union, without simultaneous publication in a country of the Union, the country of the Union of which the author is a national, provided that:</p>
      <p>(i) when these are cinematographic works the maker of which has his headquarters or his habitual residence in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country, and</p>
      <p>(ii) when these are works of architecture erected in a country of the Union or other artistic works incorporated in a building or other structure located in a country of the Union, the country of origin shall be that country.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="6">Article 6</h2>
      <p>(1) Where any country outside the Union fails to protect in an adequate manner the works of authors who are nationals of one of the countries of the Union, the latter country may restrict the protection given to the works of authors who are, at the date of the first publication thereof, nationals of the other country and are not habitually resident in one of the countries of the Union. If the country of first publication avails itself of this right, the other countries of the Union shall not be required to grant to works thus subjected to special treatment a wider protection than that granted to them in the country of first publication.</p>
      <p>(2) No restrictions introduced by virtue of the preceding paragraph shall affect the rights which an author may have acquired in respect of a work published in a country of the Union before such restrictions were put into force.</p>
      <p>(3) The countries of the Union which restrict the grant of copyright in accordance with this Article shall give notice thereof to the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization (hereinafter designated as “the Director General”) by a written declaration specifying the countries in regard to which protection is restricted, and the restrictions to which rights of authors who are nationals of those countries are subjected. The Director General shall immediately communicate this declaration to all the countries of the Union.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="6bis">Article 6<em>bis</em></h2>
      <p>(1) Independently of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right to claim authorship of the work and to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation.</p>
      <p>(2) The rights granted to the author in accordance with the preceding paragraph shall, after his death, be maintained, at least until the expiry of the economic rights, and shall be exercisable by the persons or institutions authorized by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed. However, those countries whose legislation, at the moment of their ratification of or accession to this Act, does not provide for the protection after the death of the author of all the rights set out in the preceding paragraph may provide that some of these rights may, after his death, cease to be maintained.</p>
      <p>(3) The means of redress for safeguarding the rights granted by this Article shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="7">Article 7</h2>
      <p>(1) The term of protection granted by this Convention shall be the life of the author and fifty years after his death.</p>
      <p>(2) However, in the case of cinematographic works, the countries of the Union may provide that the term of protection shall expire fifty years after the work has been made available to the public with the consent of the author, or, failing such an event within fifty years from the making of such a work, fifty years after the making.</p>
      <p>(3) In the case of anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term of protection granted by this Convention shall expire fifty years after the work has been lawfully made available to the public. However, when the pseudonym adopted by the author leaves no doubt as to his identity, the term of protection shall be that provided in <a>paragraph (1)</a>. If the author of an anonymous or pseudonymous work discloses his identity during the above-mentioned period, the term of protection applicable shall be that provided in <a>paragraph (1)</a>. The countries of the Union shall not be required to protect anonymous or pseudonymous works in respect of which it is reasonable to presume that their author has been dead for fifty years.</p>
      <p>(4) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the term of protection of photographic works and that of works of applied art in so far as they are protected as artistic works; however, this term shall last at least until the end of a period of twenty-five years from the making of such a work.</p>
      <p>(5) The term of protection subsequent to the death of the author and the terms provided by <a>paragraphs (2)</a>, <a>(3)</a> and <a>(4)</a> shall run from the date of death or of the event referred to in those paragraphs, but such terms shall always be deemed to begin on the first of January of the year following the death or such event.</p>
      <p>(6) The countries of the Union may grant a term of protection in excess of those provided by the preceding paragraphs.</p>
      <p>(7) Those countries of the Union bound by the Rome Act of this Convention which grant, in their national legislation in force at the time of signature of the present Act, shorter terms of protection than those provided for in the preceding paragraphs shall have the right to maintain such terms when ratifying or acceding to the present Act.</p>
      <p>(8) In any case, the term shall be governed by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed; however, unless the legislation of that country otherwise provides, the term shall not exceed the term fixed in the country of origin of the work.</p>

      <h2 id="7bis">Article 7<em>bis</em></h2>

      <p>(1) Authors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form.</p>
      <p>(2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to permit the reproduction of such works in certain special cases, provided that such reproduction does not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work and does not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the author.</p>
      <p>(3) Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction for the purposes of this Convention.</p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h2 id="10">Article 10</h2>

      <p>(2) It shall be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union, and for special agreements existing or to be concluded between them, to permit the utilization, to the extent justified by the purpose, of literary or artistic works by way of illustration in publications, broadcasts or sound or visual recordings for teaching, provided such utilization is compatible with fair practice.</p>

Nevertheless, the source must always be clearly indicated; the legal consequences of a breach of this obligation shall be determined by the legislation of the country where protection is claimed.</p>
      <p>(2) It shall also be a matter for legislation in the countries of the Union to determine the conditions under which, for the purpose of reporting current events by means of photography, cinematography, broadcasting or communication to the public by wire, literary or artistic works seen or heard in the course of the event may, to the extent justified by the informatory purpose, be reproduced and made available to the public.</p>

Any such change shall take effect at the beginning of the calendar year following the session.</p>
      <p>(c) The annual contribution of each country shall be an amount in the same proportion to the total sum to be contributed to the annual budget of the Union by all countries as the number of its units is to the total of the units of all contributing countries.</p>

      <p>(7)</p>

        <p>(1) Any country regarded as a developing country in conformity with the established practice of the General Assembly of the United Nations which ratifies or accedes to this Act, of which this Appendix forms an integral part, and which, having regard to its economic situation and its social or cultural needs, does not consider itself immediately in a position to make provision for the protection of all the rights as provided for in this Act, may, by a notification deposited with the Director General at the time of depositing its instrument of ratification or accession or, subject to <a>Article V(1)(c)</a>, at any time thereafter, declare that it will avail itself of the faculty provided for in <a>Article II</a>, or of the faculty provided for in <a>Article III</a>, or of both of those faculties. It may, instead of availing itself of the faculty provided for in <a>Article II</a>, make a declaration according to <a>Article V(1)(a)</a>.</p>
        <p>(2)</p>
        <p>(a) Any declaration under <a>paragraph (1)</a> notified before the expiration of the period of ten years from the entry into force of <a>Articles 1 to 21</a> and this Appendix according to <a>Article 28(2)</a> shall be effective until the expiration of the said period. Any such declaration may be renewed in whole or in part for periods of ten years each by a notification deposited with the Director General not more than fifteen months and not less than three months before the expiration of the ten-year period then running.</p>
        <p>(b) Any declaration under <a>paragraph (1)</a> notified after the expiration of the period of ten years from the entry into force of <a>Articles 1 to 21</a> and this Appendix according to <a>Article 28(2)</a> shall be effective until the expiration of the ten-year period then running. Any such declaration may be renewed as provided for in the second sentence of <a>subparagraph (a)</a>.</p>
        <p>(3) Any country of the Union which has ceased to be regarded as a developing country as referred to in <a>paragraph (1)</a> shall no longer be entitled to renew its declaration as provided in <a>paragraph (2)</a>, and, whether or not it formally withdraws its declaration, such country shall be precluded from availing itself of the faculties referred to in <a>paragraph (1)</a> from the expiration of the ten-year period then running or from the expiration of a period of three years after it has ceased to be regarded as a developing country, whichever period expires later.</p>

        <p>(5) Any country which is bound by the provisions of this Act and which has deposited a declaration or a notification in accordance with <a>Article 31(1)</a> with respect to the application of this Act to a particular territory, the situation of which can be regarded as analogous to that of the countries referred to in <a>paragraph (1)</a>, may, in respect of such territory, make the declaration referred to in <a>paragraph (1)</a> and the notification of renewal referred to in <a>paragraph (2)</a>.

        <p>(6)</p>
        <p>(a) The fact that a country avails itself of any of the faculties referred to in <a>paragraph (1)</a> does not permit another country to give less protection to works of which the country of origin is the former country than it is obliged to grant under <a>Articles 1 to 20</a>.</p>
        <p>(b) The right to apply reciprocal treatment provided for in <a>Article 30(2)(b)</a>, second sentence, shall not, until the date on which the period applicable under <a>Article I(3)</a> expires, be exercised in respect of works the country of origin of which is a country which has made a declaration according to <a>Article V(1)(a)</a>.</p>
